A Flutter project.

## Business Understanding
- Business Requirements Understanding:
-  The business goal of the app is to help customers find Doctors and to book a session with them at an available time,
   and it allow the customer to cancel appointment or reschedule it which allows the doctors to get more customers and 
   helps the business to make a profit from providing the service for both the customer and the doctors

-User Experience Thought Process:
- I suggest that to handle the payment through the app, which gives the business control over the money flow and to make great  
  deals with the customer and the doctors, for examble give the customers a 10% discount on the price and at the same time  
  Get 20% from the dictors 20% for all the customers that you bring in and all the marketing that you will be doing and the business 
  can make 10% profit on every payment, and I add a teaser in the app for the payment option.
